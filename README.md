## Overview
The **Go-Shell** is a command-line shell written in Go. It supports built-in commands, external command execution, command history, user management, input/output redirections, and more.
I also use liner to support up arrow for last history commands and Ctrl+c to abort a command

## Core Features
- **Built-in Commands:** Implementation of common shell commands.
- **Command Execution:** Ability to execute both built-in and external commands.
- **Command History:** Maintains a history of executed commands.
- **User Management:** Supports user login and logout functionality.
- **Input/Output Redirection:** Handles input/output redirections.
- **Utility Functions:** Provides various utility functions.
- **Database Support:** Connects and queries the database.
