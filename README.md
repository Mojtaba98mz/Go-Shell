## Overview
The **Bill Management System** is a Java Spring-based application that simplifies expense sharing among groups. It tracks user contributions, computes balances, and determines how much money members owe each other to settle debts.

## Swagger UI

To access the Swagger UI for the API documentation, navigate to:

- **Swagger UI URL**: `http://185.204.197.57:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

The Swagger UI will give you a user-friendly interface to interact with your API endpoints.

## CI CD Pipeline

This project is deployed using a CI/CD pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment processes. Below is an overview of the pipeline configuration.

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow:

1. **Build Job**:
    - Triggered on each push to the `master` branch.
    - The pipeline checks out the code from the repository, sets up Java 17, and runs `mvn clean package` to build the project and run tests.

2. **Deploy Job**:
    - After the build job is successfully completed, the deployment job is triggered.
    - The job sets up SSH keys and removes the previous `app.jar` from the server.
    - The new `app.jar` is copied to the server and the deployment script (`deploy.sh`) is executed.

### Pipeline Configuration:
You can view the full pipeline configuration in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.

### Core Features
- **User and Group Management:** Users can create and join groups with descriptive titles.
- **Member Tracking:** Groups can have multiple members, each identified by their name.
- **Expense Logging:** Members can pay for group expenses, recorded in the `Bill` entity with an amount field.
- **Expense Balancing:** Automatically calculates and displays how much money each member owes or is owed to balance expenses.
- **JWT Authentication:** Ensures secure access to APIs with token-based authentication.
